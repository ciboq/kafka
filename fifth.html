        <p>And you really will have to make it through 
            that violent, <br>
            metaphysical, <br>
            symbolic storm. <br>
            No matter how
            metaphysical or symbolic it might be, <br>
            make no mistake about it: 
            it will cut through flesh 
            like a thousand razor blades. 
            People will bleed there, 
            and you will bleed too; hot, red blood. 
            You’ll catch that blood in your hands, 
            your own blood and the blood of others.</p>
            <p>And once the storm is over 
                you won’t remember
                how you made it through, 
                how you managed to survive.
                You won’t even be sure, 
                in fact, whether the storm is really over.
