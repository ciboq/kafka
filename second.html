        <p>Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm <br>
            that keeps changing directions. <br>
            You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. <br>
            You turn again, but the storm adjusts. <br>
            Over and over you play this out, <br>
            like some ominous dance with death<br>
            just before dawn. <br>
            Why? <br>
            Because this storm <br>
            isn't something that blew in from far away, <br>
            something that has nothing to do with you.</p>
